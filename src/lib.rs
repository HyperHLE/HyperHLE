//! touchHLE is a high-level emulator (HLE) for iPhone OS applications.
//!
//! In various places, the terms "guest" and "host" are used to distinguish
//! between the emulated application (the "guest") and the emulator itself (the
//! "host"), and more generally, their different environments.
//! For example:
//! - The guest is a 32-bit application, so a "guest pointer" is 32 bits.
//! - The host is a 64-bit application, so a "host pointer" is 64 bits.
//! - The guest can only directly access "guest memory".
//! - The host can access both "guest memory" and "host memory".
//! - A "guest function" is emulated Arm code, usually from the app binary.
//! - A "host function" is a Rust function that is part of this emulator.
// Allow the crate to have a non-snake-case name (touchHLE).
// This also allows items in the crate to have non-snake-case names.
#![allow(non_snake_case)]
// The documentation for this crate is intended to include private items.
// rustdoc complains about some public macros that link to private items, but
// we're forced to make those macros public by the weird macro scoping rules,
// so this warning is unhelpful.
